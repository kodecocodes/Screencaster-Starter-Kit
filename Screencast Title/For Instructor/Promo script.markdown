# Course Promo Video

For each course we make or update on our site, we create a special promotional video to help spread the word about your new course in a fun and engaging way.

Promo videos should follow this structure:

1. **Welcome** the student and say **who the course is for**.
2. **Describe a problem** the target student has likely encountered.
3. **Show the solution** - your course - and what the student will be able to do by the end.
4. **Give a few details** by listing the course highlights.
5. **Call to action.**

## Script

*Add your promo script to this file using the template below!* 

*Feel free to tweak the template to better suit your course and speaking style, as long as you follow the 5 steps listed above.*
